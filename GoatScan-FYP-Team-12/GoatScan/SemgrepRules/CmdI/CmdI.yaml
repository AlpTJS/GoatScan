    message: Untrusted input might be injected into a command executed by the
      application, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. An
      attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining complete
      control of the system. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid executing OS
      commands with user input. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize
      the user input, and use safe methods for executing the commands. In PHP,
      it is possible to use `escapeshellcmd(...)` and `escapeshellarg(...)` to
      correctly sanitize input that is used respectively as system commands or
      command arguments.
